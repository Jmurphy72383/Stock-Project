# Stock-Project

Allows you to search for stock quotes and news without knowing the companies trading symbol.  Allows you to search "Netflix" instead of having to know "NFLX" and so on.  Uses the Tradier API to search for the symbol via the company name you enter.  It matches the company name with the symbol.  Then we take the symbol and search for the latest news and quotes cia the IEX API.
